# Contributing guidelines
Contributing to the project comes with the following steps:

## Issues
Create an issue, or assign one from the scrumboard. This issue has a number and a description. All the documentation, comments or other relevant documentation must be posted under the issue. It is important to keep information bundled together.

## Branches
After issue creation, a branch can be created linked to the issue. All branches follow the same naming convention: `[branch number]-[relevant title]`. Any changes relevant to the issue can be made on this branch. Commit often to keep a clear history.

## Merging
After the issue is deemed complete, it can be merged via a pull request (PR). A PR has to pass several  checks (some automatic) before it can be merged into the main branch:

1. (Automatic) The project must build
2. (Automatic) The unit tests must pass (WIP)
3. (Automatic) The style checker must pass (WIP)
4. A manual review must approve.
    - Check for naming convention
    - Check for code clarity
    - Check for comment contents

After all these checks are passed, the issue owner may merge the branch with the main branch.
